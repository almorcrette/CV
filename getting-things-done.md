## Getting Things Done

_I combine determination with pragmatism to ensure that I am dependable in delivery._

**How I delivered Power to Change's ambitious Renewal Initative on time and budget, with very positive feedback from beneficiaries, stakeholders, partners and our Board, at a time of significant upheaval at the organisation, and in society and the economy at large**

In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic put at risk Power to Change Trust's £70m of investments in upwards of 2000 community businesses around England. As one of three heads of programme, I was responsible for delivering our response. Our aim was to protect the impact of our work to date and our investments by helping organisations we invested in to step up their work in their communities at this time of need even while their trading income are devasted.

In July 2020, having just finished an initial emergency response scheme, I was asked to lead the scoping, development and delivery of a new £5.5m Renewal Initiative, to run from August 2020 - December 2021. The challenge was manifold: it was essential that this new initiative was delivered on time and on budget, in a context of enormous uncertainty and constant change, leaning on a committed but distracted and tired team.

Jointly with one of my colleagues, I focused initially on getting board sign-off for a set of high-level objectives, under which a range of interventions targetting different needs could be developed. The objectives had been informed by a scoping exercise the two of us compiled ourselves, drawn from a range emerging insights, rapid research and consultation with stakeholders.

The interventions needed to responsive and adaptable as the context inevitably changed. We mobilised an internal team whose responsibility would be to work with our existing, trusted partner organisations to design, develop and deliver different interventions.

By August, I had taken over a sole lead for the initiative, working through a coordination group of managers of each interventions. I set out clear key performance indicators, milestones dates and financial targets so we knew where we needed to be to stay on tack. I also supervised a learning partner we commissioned to help our intervention teams to remain attentive to feedback, responsive to changing circumstances, and agile in delivery.

The Renewal Initiative was delivered on time and budget. More importantly, despite profound changes in context during the period of implementation (further lockdowns, extention of government support etc.) we received with very positive feedback from beneficiary organisations, stakeholders and partners about the how well the programme's interventions had been pitched at the evolving needs of businesses during the period, and how flexible the support was.
