## Driving for impact

_I am purposeful in what I do. I zoom from the big picture to the nitty gritty and back again, to see the wood for the trees and focus on what matters._

**How my impact management consulting services helped agribusiness impact investor and project developer AgDevCo and its major stakeholder UK Government Department for International Development strengthen its evidence base for the business case for UK development investment in agribusiness in Africa.**

At Adam Smith International, I delivered an important piece of consulting work for AgDecCo, an agribusiness impact investor and project developer working in Africa receiving significant funding from UK Government's then Department for International Development (DFID). The assignment was to review and recommend how to strength AgDevCo's impact management approach.

The assignment was important because both AgDevCo and DFID wanted to strengthen the evidence base for the business case for UK investment in agribusiness in Africa. The challenge was to deliver a balance of credible critical analysis, realistic and actionable recommendations, and convincing contribution to both organisations' strategic intentions. My role was as principal consultant on the assignment, undertaking the bulk of the activity myself, with a small amount of support from a superviser and a research assistant.

I agreed with the client and stakeholders the final scope of the work, undertook the research - reviewing current practice, undertaking benchmarking, exploring options, running consultations to narrow in on a preferred strategy - and prepared a final report of recommendations. My work spanned from the simplification of a global theory of change and a conceptual framework for transformational change, to specific recommendations on monitoring planning, systems documentation, and back up to the revisions to a shared logical framework and DFID evaluation scope.

Both AgDevCo and DFID were very satisfied with the work, and adopted almost all of the recommendations. AgDevCo subsequently invested further in their capacity to deliver against the potential for robust impact measurement, and this contributed to AgDevCo's continued growth and partnership with DFID.
