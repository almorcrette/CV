## Alexis Morcrette

I am a newly trained software engineer, with more than a decade of previous professional experience in international development and social finance. I seek new challenges in tech that will harness my analytical strengths and unlock my creativity. I want to work with and learn from the best in the industry. My goal is to contribute to making our society more just and sustainable.

Over the past 12 years, I have developed into an experienced team leader, responsible for delivering ambitious investment and support programmes for community and social enterprises in the UK and the private sector in Africa and South Asia. My bosses been depended on me to nurture high-performing teams and help colleagues thrive at work. I have also made substantive contributions to corporate and public policy strategy through my research and evaluation output. 

I have a background in mathematics and philosophy from Oxford and after a stint as a mathematics and statistics teacher, I studied economic development policy, statistical methods, and sociology at London School of Economics and Political Science. Recently, I have indulged my love of learning and wide ranging interests: I have taken online courses in machine learning, complexity science, neuroscience, illustration and digital design, while also reading cosmology and about my local Anglo-saxon history.

Digital tech is a force that now profoundly shapes almost every aspect of our lives and our society, and whose influence is only set to deepen. I want to get ‘under the hood’ of the tech that curates, shepherds, frees us and contribute to leveraging it as a force for good.

## Skills

[Read about how my impact management advisory services helped agribusiness impact investor and project developer AgDevCo and its major stakeholder UK Government Department for International Development strengthen its evidence base for the business case for UK developmental investment in commercial agriculture in Africa.](/driving-for-impact.md)

#### Unknotting problems
_I am deeply analytical and dig into the roots of problems to disintengle and uncover effective and sometimes innovative solutions._

- My expertise focuses particularly on delivering economic research, market and business intelligence, building social performance management systems, and conducting independent evaluations.
- I have deployed these skills to contribute to strategic decision-making and adaptive management in impact investing, grant-making and technical assistance programmes and shared value initiatives.

#### Eagle-eyed... and -beaked
_I am very observant, quick to notice things, and have a strong attention to detail. I am also relentless in my pursuit of high standards._

- At Power to Change and at ASI, I was responsible for ensuring programme compliance to various national and international legislation and regulation.
- This includes UK Charity Law, OECD’s Oversees Development Assistance rules, DFID’s guidelines on working through the private sector and Donor Committee for Enterprise Development (DCED)’s Standard for measuring results in private sector development.

#### Getting things done
_I combine determination with pragmatism to ensure that I am reliably dependable._

- For example, in 2020 I emerged as Power to Change's leader in its Covid-19 response. Within the first four months of the pandemic and the first national lockdown, I'd delivered a £2.2m emergency trading income support scheme from conception to disbursement, injecting critical cashflow support into 100 community businesses who'd had to close their doors, enabling them to continue to deliver critical local services.
- The scheme's success resulted in being given the brief to scope, develop and deliver a follow-up £5.5m one-year funding, support and investment during, which I executed on time and to budget at a time when the organisation was going through a massive restructure.

#### Nurturing people
_I am a team player. I dedicated to helping my colleagues to thrive so that they can support me in return, and together we perform exceptionally._

- At Power to Change and Adam Smith International, my bosses been depended on me to nurture high-performing teams and help colleagues thrive at work. I have come to believe strongly that looking after staff will bring out the best in them and the best for their employers.
