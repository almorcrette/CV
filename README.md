# Alexis Morcrette - Curriculum Vitae / Resume

I trained and began to work as a full stack software engineer in 2022. I have more than a decade of previous professional experience in international development and social finance.

I seek challenges in tech that harness my analytical strengths and unlock my creativity. I love continuously deepening my knowledge of pure typed functional programming. I also like working with data.

I currently work for Capgemini as a Scala Developer on HM Revenue & Customs' Online Payments Service.

In my previous work, I was responsible for investment and support programmes that helped communities in England acquire local buildings and other assets they care about and build social enterprises around them. Before that I managed, consulted on, monitored and evaluated economic development and public health programmes in Africa and South Asia.

Over those 12 years, I developed into an experienced team leader. My bosses have depended on me to nurture high-performing teams and help colleagues thrive at work.

I have a background in mathematics and philosophy from Oxford and after a stint as a mathematics and statistics teacher in New Zealand, I studied economic development policy, statistical methods and sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 2022, I completed an intensive 4-month full stack web development bootcamp with Makers Academy and subsequently joined Makers' Accelerator programme, specialising in software engineering in functional Scala.
