## Nurturing people

_I am a team player. I am dedicated to helping my colleagues to thrive so that they can support me in return, and together we perform exceptionally._

**How I used the delivery a mission-critical programme at pace at a time of crisis as an opportunitiy to motivate my colleagues and invest in their long-term skills development.**

When Covid hit the UK in 2020 and I was working at Power to Change Trust, I managed a short, targeted grant-making intervention between April - July 2020. The objective of the initiative was to provide funding to our largest investments to substitute lost trading income and protect the community businesses and their projects in the community.

We needed to put Â£2.2m out quickly, but also put it to best use, so we needed to undertake enough analysis of business finances to target the funding.

I decided to deliver the programme in-house, drawing on my often junior colleagues whose work had been suspended and who were desperate to contribute meaningfully to Covid response efforts. I created a buddy system so that each junior assessor would be able to get coaching from an experienced financial analyst so that they would gain the skills and confidence to assess applications. We also held weekly retros with the whole team to contribute to continuous improvement of the assessment methodology over time.

The scheme was a great success. We delivered it on budget within four months, with great feedback from clients and our leadership team. What I am most proud about is the feedback from the team, who found the whole experience really rewarding and empowering, and left them with a confidence in a new in-demand, technical skillset. I was told when I started the scheme that 'crisis is not the time for staff development'. I knew they were wrong, and I proved it.
