## Eagle-eyed

_I am very observant, quick to notice things, and have a strong attention to detail. I am also relentless in my pursuit of high standards._

**How my attention to detail ensured high levels of policy compliance at Adam Smith International and Power to Change Trust, contributing to industry credibility and strengthening the evidence base for what works**

At both Adam Smith International (ASI) and at Power to Change, I held positions where I was responsible to ensuring policy compliance across distributed teams.

At ASI I provided direction on results management functions in large and complex UK Government Department for International Development programmes in Democratic Republic of Congo, Northern Nigeria and Sierra Leone. These functions were required to comply with the Donor Committee for Enterprise Developmentâ€™s Standard for Measuring Private Sector Development, so that the programmes could be effectively reviewed, evaluated and contribute to the evidence base for the business case for development investment in private sector development.

At Power to Change Trust, I was responsible for compliance to our manual of regulations, to cover the trust on areas of Charity Law, fraud and anti-money laundering, data protection and safeguarding.

In both cases, I deployed a range of tools to fulfil my brief, from procedural manuals, training programmes, communities of practice, to internal audits, investigations and programmes of correct measures where they were required. I had to lead by example in our pursuit of high standards, be constantly on the look out through both formal processes and informally to flags that signalled something was amiss, and have an exceptionally strong attention to detail, often in subject areas that I was not an expert, liaising and with informing critical stakeholders in situations of high risk.

My tenures in these roles and the time after my departure have been generally uneventful, a good sign when working on compliance. External audits of our compliance coverage have been very positive. Stakeholders (including the Police on one occasion) have been very satisfied with our baseline standards and how we ran the occasionally investigations and programmes of corrective measures.
